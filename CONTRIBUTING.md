# Contributing to HoopGlow

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Develop with GitHub

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use a Two-Branches System

Pull requests must be sent to the `development` branch and, once approved, are merged into `main` by the maintainers.

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project.

## Submitting Changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to HoopGlow](https://github.com/Makerspace-Ashoka/HoopGlow/pull/new/development) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

```sh
git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit" -m "A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
```

The idea is for our commits to NOT end up [here](https://twitter.com/gitlost).

## Coding Conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimise for readability:

- We indent using two spaces (soft tabs)
- We use ESLint to ensure consistency with everything JS
- This is open-source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them.

Thank you for your contributions!
