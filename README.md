## Features

- LED array behind the basketball backboard.
- Different light-up modes for various point scores.
- Wireless triggering of the backboard.
- Customised CAD models for LED array brackets.

### Prerequisites

List what they need and how to install them:

- Software tools: if you have a working dev environment, you should be able to get up to speed.
- Hardware components: show up at the Makerspace (AC03 - 007) to get your hands on some of the LED strips and a testing jig very kindly set up in one of our community mentor's dorm room. If you need a controller, come find us.

### Installing

We will add a step-by-step guide to getting the development environment up and running in this section as the `main` branch starts getting populated.

## Git Commit Guidelines

To maintain a clear and understandable history, we follow these commonly accepted commit message practices*:

1. **Separate subject from body with a blank line.**
2. **Limit the subject line to 50 characters.**
3. **Capitalize the subject line.**
4. **Do not end the subject line with a period.**
5. **Use the imperative mood in the subject line.**
6. **Wrap the body at 72 characters.**
7. **Use the body to explain what and why vs. how.**

These rules are adopted from [that one Chris Beams article](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/). It encapsulates common best practices from the open-source software community with decent verbosity.

The *imperative mood* in rule 5 refers to a linguistic form that essentially makes a commit subject line a command or instruction, giving the message a directive tone. Imagine each commit message completes the sentence "This commit will...". For example, write "Add feature" instead of "Added feature" or "Adding feature."

Example:

```txt
Refactor subsystem X for readability

This simplifies the implementation of X and separates concerns for future enhancements. It primarily involves refactoring Y to improve modularity and prepare for the subsequent integration of feature Z.
```

The subject line "Refactor subsystem X for readability" completes the sentence "This commit will...refactor subsystem X for readability".
